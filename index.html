                        <p>I am what people in the Nashville area call a Unicorn. That means I was born and raised in
                            the greater Nashville area and apparently that is rare. I went to high school at Merrol
                            Hyde Magnet School in Sumner County. After high school, I moved to Atlanta, GA for two
                            years to play junior hockey. From there, hockey took me to West Virginia University where
                            I earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering while playing hockey for WVU. I
                            still play hockey today in a "beer" league in Nashville.</p>

                        <p>While in high school, I met my future ex-girlfriend/ future ex-fiancé/ current wife. We
                            married in 2016 and we two dogs that run our lives. Together, we enjoy traveling, spending
                            time on the lake, going to Predators games, or eating pizza in bed, like we did for our
                            second anniversary. We balance each other out and complement each other’s personalities
                            very well and I enjoy every day with her. (Had to be nice in case she reads this.)</p>

                        <p>I currently am a sales engineer for a manufacture’s rep for commercial air conditioning
                            company. It is not the worst job in the world, but I don't find myself looking forward to
                            going to work every day and it is very stressful. I spoke with a friend that had completed
                            a bootcamp and got a job as a front-end developer. Listening to her explain her job and
                            the day to day of low stress and working from home got me very interested in looking into
                            this career path. After I investigated it, the more I felt like it would be for me. One of
                            my favorite projects in college was programming a car to stay so far away from a curved
                            wall and I did all the programming for the group. I should have taken then hint then and
                            made the change to focus on coding then, but it took me a while to wise up. Regardless of
                            how I got here, here I am, and I look forward to continuing to learn more and more every
                            day.</p>
