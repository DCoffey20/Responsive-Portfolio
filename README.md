# Responsive-Portfolio

Creating a portfolio that will change and adapt to the different screen sizes it is opened in, ie, phone, tablet, computer monitor, etc..

Portfolio will consist of three sepearate html files to create the individual pages all linked together. I will be using bootstrap to style the html pages to create the desired visual apperance. The pages should have a navbar and responsive images and a responsive layout.

These pages should increase my understand and ability to apply bootstrap to a html file for an easier styling experience.
